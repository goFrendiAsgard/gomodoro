# gomodoro #

Fork of pTimer, Pomodoro Timer Unity applet.

Original version: https://github.com/rollbackpt/pTimer/

**How to install:**

```bash
# Download and run the installer
wget -O pTimer.zip https://github.com/goFrendiAsgard/gomodoro/archive/master.zip
unzip pTimer.zip && cd pTimer-master/
./install.sh

# Now run it from everywhere just by typing
ptimer

# Or better, add it as startup application

```

**How is it different from:**

* Tick sound while working (I like it)
* Change the icon into simpler one

**Todo:**

* Add `kanban` method
